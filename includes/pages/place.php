    <p>Today, the land itself is still called Chinook and the 70 acres of forest and meadow lands are protected by a conservation easement. Whidbey Institute has grown from inspiring idea to a fully operational Institute with professional staff, year-round programs, new and upgraded facilities and national outreach. The vision, commitment, hard work, and financial generosity of many people have made it possible and have given Whidbey Institute a strong base of experience, a wide range of friends, and wisdom born of honest endeavor over time.</p>
